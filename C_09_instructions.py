***** Instructions *****

This Program will ask you for...
- The name of the product that you are selling
- How many items you plan on selling
- The costs for each component of the product
- How much money you want to make

When you have entered all the items, press 'xxx' to quit.

The program will then display an itemised list of the costs
 with subtotals for the variable and fixed costs.
Finally it will tell you how much you should sell
 each item for to reach your profit goal.

The data will also be automatically written to a text file which
 has the same name as your product
